## This is a description for the project.

Emotions in Drama (short EmoDrama) is a research project funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and part of the priority programme SPP 2207 Computational Literary Studies (CLS) for three years (Project number 424207618 , Research Grants DE 2188/3-1 und WO 835/4-1).

EmoDrama is situated in the research area of computational literary studies (CLS). The research is focused on historical German plays for the timeframe of 1650-1815. We develop emotion annotation schemes and processes that are directed towards ideas and working practices of literary scholars.
